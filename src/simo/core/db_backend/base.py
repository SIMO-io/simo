"""Custom PostGIS database wrapper with light self-healing.

We retry cursor creation on transient driver-level errors. Previously we
were catching Django's wrapper exceptions (django.db.utils.InterfaceError/
OperationalError). However, those are only raised by the outer
`wrap_database_errors` context. Inside `create_cursor()` the driver
(`psycopg2`) raises its own exceptions, so our except block never ran and
connections weren't healed.

By catching psycopg2 errors here (in addition to Django's), we ensure
we can close() and reconnect() this connection when `self.connection`
is already closed or becomes unusable, avoiding busy error loops in
MQTT threads and periodic tasks.
